In this directory two subdirs exist.

NIS2LDAP_migrations

In this directory are the scripts I used/made to migrate a NIS domain to LDAP. There are also padl-tools (see the internet) but I found these to be to cluttered.

SETUP_LDAPSERVER

In this directory are some helpful ldif and scripts to setup propper LDAP support for NIS/AUTOFS/Etc... (really helpful!!!!)
